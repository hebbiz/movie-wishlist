# Proposed next experiment: regional card first

Design only, updated October 18, 2026 after owner-run URL Context tests and
completion of manual Kinobaza candidate experiment A.
MW-FUT-01 remains **Discovery**. No prompt,
runtime, model/settings, provider, output limit or integration is changed here.
The [owner observations](digital-ua-owner-validation.md) motivate narrower
questions, not an accuracy claim or a production recommendation. The current
proposal below supersedes the earlier prompt-clarification preference and the
now-completed manual candidate-discovery experiment. The
implemented fixed-card URL-only experiment is documented separately in the
existing PoC guide; no implementation handoff is prepared here.

## Proposed sequence and evidence boundaries

1. Discover a concrete regional card, not just a film/platform name. The owner
   independently locates the Ukrainian card in Safari; do not invent an ID or
   accept interface language/country URL alone as entitlement evidence.
2. Check film identity: title, film year, director and, for Blade Runner, explicit
   Final Cut identification. A different Apple ID requires reconciliation, not
   automatic acceptance/rejection. An unresolved cut remains unknown.
3. Check each aspect separately in its regional/account context: viewing
   availability; audio languages/formats; subtitle languages/types; 4K, HD,
   HDR10 and Dolby Vision individually; subscription/rental/purchase and price.
4. Retain **unknown** where evidence is missing or cannot be reproduced. A
   search miss is not unavailability; an incomplete list is not proven absence;
   an inaccessible URL is not proof of invalidity. Do not substitute typical
   distribution formats for direct evidence.
5. Keep original film language distinct from offered audio, an account's Play
   button distinct from new rental/purchase, and catalogue metadata distinct
   from that account's viewing entitlement. Never transfer global/foreign
   properties to the Ukrainian offer.

These are manual review questions, not a normalized schema, confidence engine,
automatic ranking or extraction pipeline. Keep audio before subtitles, then
video; preserve the existing Ukrainian-localization priorities.

## Agreed auxiliary discovery source

Owner-agreed documentation checkpoint, October 18, 2026: **Кінобаза (Kinobaza)**
is an additional source of Ukrainian film titles and candidate URLs, not a new
integration or a final authority on an offer.

Proposed future flow (not the current runtime):

TMDb / Кінобаза / web search → candidate regional cards → film/cut identity and
offer-characteristic checks → Mykola recommendation.

Кінобаза is not final evidence of offer availability/entitlement, current prices,
audio or video format of a particular provider offer/edition. General film
localization does not establish localization at a provider. Its data may
originate from JustWatch and may not be independent of TMDb. Shared upstream
information is not independent
corroboration; titles/links are leads to verify against the exact regional card,
not grounds for transferring characteristics between offers or editions.

API availability, automated-access permission, attribution requirements and
retention remain **open questions**, not approved capabilities or rights. No
automatic integration, scraping or discovery-to-fetch pipeline is added. This
conceptual flow does not authorize collecting grounded links into a fetch queue.
MW-FUT-01 remains Discovery. The current [URL-only PoC](url-context-poc.md) keeps
its fixed, verified server-side cards; Кінобаза does not populate that catalogue
or supply runtime input.

## Next experiment: current Ukrainian availability

The [two reported URL-only tests](digital-ua-owner-validation.md#url-context-evaluation-checkpoint--two-owner-run-live-tests)
provided identity/audio metadata but left availability and transaction fields
unknown. The provider's full retrieved content is unavailable; the cause of
omissions remains unresolved. Retrieval SUCCESS is not truth or entitlement.

The previous **manual experiment A is now completed for Coherence and Dune**:
see the [owner candidate-discovery record](digital-ua-owner-validation.md#kinobaza-candidate-discovery--manual-experiment-a-completed).
Kinobaza led to useful cards, including owner-confirmed Coherence availability
and Ukrainian audio on Prime Video. Dune audio observations remain tied to
HBO Max, Rakuten TV and separately checked Prime Video; no missing URL/provenance
or access type is invented. Earlier Apple/MEGOGO checks remain historical.

This is evidence for candidate-source utility in two cases, not completeness,
general accuracy or automatic-integration feasibility. The next question is
how to obtain candidate links responsibly without confusing an aggregator
signal with a current Ukrainian offer. The comparison below replaces the old
A-first recommendation; no new implementation is authorized.

## Candidate integration feasibility

Public documentation checked **October 18, 2026**. This review used read-only
public pages and official documentation, including the downloadable OpenAPI
document, **not Gemini/TMDb API calls**. No private endpoints, account automation,
cookies, scraping or bypass. Public access and robots.txt are not permission.

### TMDb: documented capability versus Ukraine coverage

- [Movie Watch Providers](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/movie-watch-providers)
  documents country-keyed, per-film provider availability supplied through
  JustWatch. It explicitly does **not** return full provider deep links: the
  country `link` is a **TMDb watch-page link**, not the exact provider offer.
  JustWatch attribution is explicitly required.
- The [official OpenAPI document](https://developer.themoviedb.org/openapi/tmdb-api.json)
  shows country examples with access buckets `flatrate`, `rent`, `buy` and
  `ads` when present. Provider entries describe
  `provider_id`, `provider_name`, `logo_path` and `display_priority`.
  These are aggregator/provider signals, not account entitlement. This response
  does not document offer prices, offered audio/subtitles or video formats.
- [Movie Providers](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/watch-providers-movie-list)
  allows country filtering with `watch_region`;
  [Available Regions](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/watch-providers-available-regions)
  documents the method for discovering countries with provider data. The
  [Discover Movie reference](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/discover-movie)
  and its OpenAPI parameters separate territory from monetization filters
  (`flatrate/free/ads/rent/buy`); language is not an offered-audio filter.
- **Ukraine is not verified by this review.** The inspected static OpenAPI
  movie example, its country-specific example schema and available-regions
  example do not contain `UA`. Examples are not a current exhaustive coverage
  guarantee or proof of non-support. Do not promise Ukrainian provider results
  for either film, invent a provider list or translate absent data into
  unavailable. A future separately approved API probe would first establish
  current region support and then inspect each film's `results.UA`, if present.
  No such probe was run here.

### TMDb: permission, attribution, retention and cost

- **Documented general terms, not AI clearance:** the
  [developer FAQ](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/faq) describes
  non-commercial API use as free with attribution, commercial licensing through
  sales (no price established here), and no SLA. It requires an approved TMDb
  logo and prominent non-endorsement notice in About/Credits. Watch-provider
  data additionally requires the JustWatch attribution above. Neither billing
  category nor the applicable agreement for this project is settled here.
- **Explicit restriction signal; current legal text needs verification:** an
  indexed first-party version of the
  [API Terms of Use](https://www.themoviedb.org/api-terms-of-use?language=en-CA)
  (labelled October 20, 2023; search index crawled over a year before this review)
  prohibits API/content use in connection with AI/ML applications, not only
  training. It also restricts derivatives, caching beyond six months and
  requires purging content on termination. Direct reading of the current legal
  page was blocked by robots; these are **indexed terms, not a fresh verification
  of the effective agreement**. They are a reason to hold, not a license for
  six-month storage or an assertion about a newly checked contract.
- **Unresolved:** applicable current agreement and any exception for candidate
  discovery in an AI-connected product, downstream transfer to another model,
  normalization/derived fields and retention. Do not pass TMDb data/links to
  Mykola or another LLM based on the FAQ's general free-use statement. Resolve
  this scope before an automatic experiment; this review neither contacts the
  provider nor changes existing production TMDb use.
- Provider API rights would not automatically grant rights to the destination
  sites' content. The existing [tool/source-rights review](url-context-poc.md#official-capabilities-display-and-terms-review)
  remains separate; Google Search reuse rules are not automatically applied to
  every URL-only route, nor treated as permission to harvest grounded links.

### Kinobaza: what was and was not found

- [About](https://kinobaza.com.ua/about) describes a Ukrainian film catalogue
  with ordinary title search. The
  [Dune: Part Two public title page](https://kinobaza.com.ua/titles/dune-part-two)
  visibly contains Ukrainian title/provider links and country sections.
  Its watch section credits JustWatch; some links target
  `click.justwatch.com`. This checks public source/provenance presentation,
  **not** the owner's provider availability/audio observations.
- TMDb explicitly credits JustWatch and Kinobaza visibly uses it in this block.
  Thus overlapping provider signals may share upstream data and are not
  independent corroboration. This does not establish that every Kinobaza
  title/localization field comes from JustWatch or is copied from TMDb.
- **Not found:** a public documented movie/provider-link API or another
  explicitly supported automated export/interface, with authentication,
  fields, coverage and usage contract. Review scope: public About, Terms,
  Privacy, the title page and site-scoped searches for API/developer
  documentation. This is **not a finding that no API exists**; no undocumented
  endpoints were tested.
- [Privacy](https://kinobaza.com.ua/privacy) mentions RSS/API distribution of
  public discussion/user contributions. That is not a documented catalogue/
  provider-link interface or permission for our automated access.
- [Terms](https://kinobaza.com.ua/terms) apply to registered and unregistered
  users and place responsibility for use/third-party rights on the user.
  The reviewed pages do **not establish** automated access, redistribution to
  another model, extraction/normalization, attribution rules for an integration
  or retention/cache rights for movie/provider data. These remain unresolved;
  silence and public accessibility are not grants. No supported plan, API
  tariff, limits or SLA were found; costs are **unknown**, not zero.
- Manual discovery is owner-agreed research, not authorization for scraping or
  future public redistribution. Provider-specific prices, localization and
  entitlement still require their own offer/context checks.

## Options for the next technical step (design only)

| Option | Value and coverage limits | Complexity and dependencies | Known costs and unresolved questions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **A. TMDb provider discovery + manual exact URLs** | Structured country/provider/access-type leads; exact destinations still manual. Current UA/two-film coverage unverified; no offer audio/video/price or entitlement guarantee. | Small isolated server-side API step plus manual link entry, only after permission and UA capability checks. Needs owner credential, attribution and error/unknown handling; no direct-URL resolver inferred. | FAQ's free non-commercial category is conditional, commercial quote unknown; not a zero-cost project estimate. Current AI-use/transfer/cache agreement unresolved. No API call approved here. |
| **B. TMDb + documented supported Kinobaza interface** | Could add Ukrainian titles/exact-link candidates if the interface actually exposes them; shared JustWatch signals are not independent. Coverage/fields unknown. | Cannot size or select transport: supported public interface was **not found**. Depends on authoritative documentation/permission, fields, access limits, attribution and retention, plus A's gates. | No established plan/tariff; cost and maintenance unknown. Not feasible to implement on current evidence; do not substitute internal endpoints or scraping. |
| **C. Kinobaza as a manual auxiliary source** | Already useful for these two films; owner chooses exact regional cards and checks offers. Human coverage is bounded, not complete or automatically current. | Lowest complexity: no provider adapter. A proposed owner-curated link-only preview could exercise navigation/provenance separation without source-site fetching or model calls. Depends on ordinary owner access and manual identity checks. | Owner time/device/network and any provider/account charges are not measured; no automatic-integration tariff established. Redistribution/retention/AI forwarding of source data remains unapproved. |

Unknown usage/cost is not a blocker and is not zero. No integration is chosen
from the absence of documentation. The conceptual multi-source architecture
above is retained, not implemented or expanded on assumptions.

## Recommendation (design only, no implementation handoff)

Choose **C next**: propose a tiny isolated, owner-curated **candidate-link
preview**, followed by manual Safari offer verification. Its new technical
question is whether link navigation and provenance can be kept separate from
identity, availability and offer characteristics across providers. This is not
another test of whether Kinobaza is useful: manual experiment A already
established usefulness in the reported cases.

Minimum proposed change in a separately approved iteration: a bounded preview
of the two films' explicitly owner-supplied public URLs and source labels, with
no automatic source retrieval, LLM call, response normalization, raw content
storage or arbitrary browser URL input. No runtime catalogue changes now.
Do not repurpose Google-grounded links as a fetch queue. Owner observations
may be discussed separately; they must not become prefilled provider facts.

### Acceptance criteria for that proposed experiment

- Only Coherence and Dune, explicit exact URLs and known provenance; absent
  destinations stay unconfigured. The Coherence Prime URL is available from
  the owner record. Obtain missing Dune URLs from the owner rather than infer
  them. Dune Prime origin remains unreported, not Kinobaza.
- Candidate discovery never auto-confirms identity, availability or properties.
  Keep those four evidence stages visibly distinct; no aggregator localization
  transfer between providers, no original-language-to-track inference.
- Opening a link makes no Gemini/TMDb/Kinobaza backend request. No source-page
  scraping, credentials/cookies to the demo, persistence or live content archive.
  Current Search/URL-only modes, auth and one-shot behavior stay unchanged.
- Manual comparison can reconcile at least one exact provider candidate with an
  offer-specific UA observation, or records the unresolved result without
  claiming experiment success. Playback controls, new transactions and
  metadata remain separate; unknown is acceptable, not unavailable.
- No general accuracy/completeness claim, purchase/subscription requirement,
  legal assurance or new integration. Rights questions must be revisited before
  any automatic A/B experiment or forwarding of data to Mykola.

### Manual test plan: Termius → iPhone/Safari

1. In Termius inspect the correct checkout/HEAD and use the existing
   `Status-Demo.ps1` only if inspecting a running demo. **Do not stop or
   reconfigure the owner's active process for this documentation checkpoint.**
   Preserve the [iPhone guide](iphone-windows.md), trusted-LAN Basic Auth and
   existing synthetic-first/reload rules for any later approved preview test.
2. In Safari, using the owner's Ukrainian context without VPN, manually open
   the known Coherence Prime candidate and Apple control. For Dune obtain
   exact destinations first through normal owner navigation; missing URLs
   terminate that case as unconfigured. Do not press the demo's live button.
3. Verify film identity, territorial offer/access separately, then Ukrainian
   audio and subtitles, each video property, access type/price only if visible.
   Do not require a purchase, successful playback or access to hidden metadata.
   Record a concise owner observation in discussion, not live page/model text,
   account details, screenshots, raw metadata or an evidence archive.
4. For a later separately approved link-preview prototype, compare each
   displayed destination/provenance with the manually opened card; test that
   unknown fields remain unknown and opening a candidate cannot invoke a
   model/API. This checkpoint does not implement or claim to test that UI.
5. **Stop criteria:** two films completed, no exact URL/identity, ambiguous
   territory/account access, blocked/login-only automation, payment required
   to investigate, or unclear permission for the proposed technical step.
   Stop as unresolved; do not bypass, buy, add a provider/scraper or fall back
   to automatic discovery. Revisit A/B only after their documented gates.

This recommendation preserves the current fixed Apple catalogue and iPhone
workflow. All runtime/prompts/model/settings remain unchanged. No API calls,
dependencies, system changes, deployment or implementation handoff accompany
this documentation checkpoint. MW-FUT-01 remains **Discovery**.
