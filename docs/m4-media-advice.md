# M4 — Mykola media advice

Status: M4.1–M4.3 implemented; narrow #192 blocker fixes validated locally;
default off; no live activation authorized. Pilot preparation is conditional on
independent review and the activation prerequisites below, not a pilot approval.
Canonical implementation record, not a second research architecture. Evidence and
source boundaries remain in [research proposal](../research/grounded-answer-demo/docs/regional-card-proposal.md).

## Reviewed baseline and sequence

`develop` acbdadf8efa2d180a12ed3fc85aa7784bb681782 (2026-10-20).
Existing static add/edit form writes only on Save; no feature-capability system
exists. Group owner/member may edit; visitors may not. Migration files 001–016
are historical evidence, not proof of their deployed state. Owner checkout is
excluded from implementation.

1. **M4.1 — implemented, offline/browser-tested, live-unvalidated** isolated accessible form dialog, source-row selection, explicit
   medium/URL diff and local-only transfer. Capability fails closed until M4.2.
   Authored fixtures exist only in tests. No social-chat controller reuse.
2. **M4.2 — implemented, isolated SQL/mock-tested, live-unvalidated** authenticated Netlify boundary, backend-only per-user assignment,
   independently gated TMDb/MOTN and atomic technical ledger. New SQL only;
   migration application/production flags/secrets require separate authorization.
3. **M4.3 — implemented, mock/browser-tested, live-unvalidated** replaceable Brave Web Search resolver, ≤2 queries and ≤2 sequential
   admitted Kinobaza card GETs; no redirect/retry/destination resolution.

Each stage has a separate stacked PR; no merge/deployment in this task.

## Contracts and invariants

Form context: user + group + established IMDb identity + optional group-list ID
+ random form session. Typed title alone is insufficient. New film/group,
cancel, successful Save or logout invalidates it. Late responses are discarded.
Reopening retains same-session results. Abort does not refund a server attempt.
Only `recommended_medium` and `purchase_url` are transferable; no ownership,
status, title/year or added-by changes. Missing URL requires explicit clearing,
never silent retention of a different platform's URL. Form edits after preview
invalidate that preview. Affiliate/tracking acknowledgement preserves exact href.
Unsupported/unmapped platforms remain read-only. Source rows never merge.
Preview has its own opaque in-memory selection token, separate from discovery
generation. Cancel, Escape, close, re-render and any new selection revoke it.
After asynchronous access verification, both that token and the current form
context/field snapshot must still match before the two local fields can change.

## Source use and activation

Implementation/offline checks are not live validation or rights clearance.
No source/rules GET is authorized here. Existing dated research reviews do not
grant blanket production or arbitrary-card permission. Before live activation,
a separately authorized preflight must check current TMDb, MOTN, Kinobaza and
Brave terms, attribution, transient projection/transfer and permitted access.
Brave search does not license destination content. No LLM or full-body archive.
No current production feature assignment, secret or migration is changed.

## Pilot (future, not executed)

Choose five actual owner Wishlist films before running; record their identities,
not a replacement exotic risk set. One trigger per film, no retries. Record
resolver candidate acceptance, identity outcome, extracted claims, useful links,
calls/time, intervention, transfer and preservation of manual edits. Missing
offers are not resolver failure. One brief owner session; no platform sweep.

## Validation and remaining work

M4.1 authored offline/browser validation covers capability failure, isolated
dialog, stale response and preview, exact URLs/acknowledgement, missing URL and
transfer-only fields. M4.2/M4.3 add server authz/concurrency/resolver tests.
Windows launcher components are unchanged and are outside this integration.
MW-FUT-01 remains Discovery; production readiness is a separate decision.

## M4.2 server and migration contract

Implemented, mock/offline tested; live-unvalidated. The server verifies a Supabase
Auth user (not user metadata), then calls service-role-only
`media_advice_action`. Every capability/start/reserve/finish checks backend
permission, fresh owner/member membership and (edit only) list/group/IMDb relation.
Add accepts an established IMDb selection without requiring an existing list row;
the server resolves/validates the crosswalk itself. No client result/role/counter
is accepted. Failed capability leaves normal editing usable.

No trusted TMDb preview is retained by the existing form lookup. Therefore the
full M4 ceiling is **8 source HTTP attempts**: IMDb Find 1 + Details 1 + UA
providers 1 + MOTN title 1 + Brave search ≤2 + Kinobaza cards ≤2. M4.2 alone ≤4.
Missing/ambiguous crosswalk skips MOTN, never guesses an ID. Details/providers
failure does not suppress an independent MOTN attempt with established crosswalk;
its own metadata/ID gate may still withhold claims. Identity Details are reused
within the action for localization/resolver, without additional fan-out.
The handler clock starts at entry, before reading the body, Auth or ledger RPCs.
Sources have only the remainder of the first **45s**; Auth and each RPC have at
most 8s and never more than the remaining phase time. At most one finish attempt
can use the next 8s, ending by 53s from entry. A 2s application response margin
and a further 5s platform margin fit Netlify's documented synchronous 60s limit.
Existing smaller adapter bounds remain; no budget increase or retry. Abort is
propagated to network/body waits; an awaited operation that ignores abort is
also raced against its deadline. This is an operational bound, not latency data.
The response distinguishes dispatched source attempts from the finish RPC's
durable reservation count. If a reservation reply is lost, no HTTP dispatch is
authorized by that reply; the ledger may still have consumed the slot. If the
whole action reply is lost, accounting is unknown to the client, not zero.
Deadline exhaustion returns 504 without source results. If a session ID was
received, the server makes one best-effort finish within its remaining margin,
never retries finish or fetch. Failed/lost finish withholds results; it may have
committed or left the session unfinished. Either way reservations are not refunded,
the form/action cannot replay, and the 30-minute TTL plus retention cleanup apply.
An unknown start outcome cannot be finished by guessed ID and is not retried.

Migration `20261020205122_media_advice_access_ledger.sql` was created using
Supabase CLI 2.121.0. It creates only a new private schema, default-off permission
assignments, technical sessions and restricted RPCs. New tables have RLS and no
anon/authenticated privileges; RPCs are service-role only. An advisory transaction
lock serializes a user's new sessions and reservations; no lock spans source I/O.
Follow-up `20261021072002_media_advice_review_fixes.sql` rechecks permission,
fresh group role and edit-card context **after** acquiring the advisory lock,
before any ledger mutation, including queued start/reserve/finish operations.
Permission expiration is checked against wall-clock time after that wait.
Per form session: one action; fixed stage names each reserved at most once,
maximum eight. Per user: twenty sessions per rolling 24h (including expired
30-minute sessions). Errors/lost responses consume reservations. No response,
HTML, credential or chat persistence. No session replay/result recovery.

Retention origin is the immutable action session's `created_at` (not its last
reservation, finish, logout or form close). Rows become eligible at age **24h**,
whether finished or abandoned, after their 30-minute active TTL has expired.
A still-active row is preserved defensively, including an anomalously extended
TTL; it becomes an overdue-monitor finding, not a reason to delete active work.
Daily service-only `media_advice_cleanup()` is expected to delete eligible rows
at ages **24–48h under a healthy scheduler**; opportunistic same-user cleanup can
delete them earlier within that window. There is **no guaranteed 48h ceiling**
during scheduler/DB failure. Movie, group-list/Wishlist and permission rows are
not deleted by cleanup. Permission assignments
persist until an authorized administrator revokes/removes them. No assignment
is seeded. No global historical RLS repairs or production migration commands.

Prepared, **not installed/activated**:
[inactive pg_cron job configuration](../supabase/operations/media-advice-cleanup.schedule.sql)
and [content-free health query](../supabase/operations/media-advice-cleanup.sql).
The daily job is named `mykola-media-advice-cleanup`, 02:15 UTC; configuration
refuses a non-UTC scheduler or an existing same-name job and creates it inactive
in one transaction. There is no `cron.schedule` in an automatic migration.
Enabling pg_cron/job requires later explicit authorization and baseline review.
Denys, as backend operator, owns activation and daily independent monitoring:
missing heartbeat, >26h since success, failed/inactive job or rows aged ≥48h
require investigation. The private singleton heartbeat stores only last success
and deletion count, atomically with deletion; a failed transaction cannot report
success. Inspect `cron.job` / `cron.job_run_details`; recover via one authorized
cleanup, never source replay or rate-counter reset. Before activation assign an
independent daily check/alert outside this cleanup job; a stopped scheduler
cannot report its own total outage. Cleanup health is backend-only, not browser
content. Cron history pruning remains an operator concern, not source archival.

Local validation uses PGlite 0.5.10 (test-only PostgreSQL/WASM), minimal authored
prerequisites, and this new SQL only. It proves SQL execution/privileges/replay,
not production migration history or native multi-connection/load behavior.
Native PostgreSQL **17.6** was additionally run in an isolated loopback cluster
with 24 distinct backend connections (matching the previously recorded target
major/minor, not querying production to attest its current version). Both new
M4 migrations run against authored prerequisites only; production migration
history/baseline reconciliation remains pre-activation work. No old SQL replay.

Server configuration (no values in Git): `SUPABASE_URL`,
`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `TMDB_READ_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `MOTN_API_KEY`;
M4.3 additionally `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY`. Secrets are not arguments/URLs/UI data.
No configuration is changed by these PRs. Approved TMDb logo/complete current
attribution and applicable commercial/source-use terms must be checked during
activation preflight; text attribution and source links remain visible now.

## M4.3 automatic resolver and UI

No manual card field is required. The swappable search interface uses ordinary
Brave Web Search `GET https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search`, with
server-only `X-Subscription-Token`. A verified original title/alias, year and
director form a domain-limited query. Snippets/rank never establish identity or
claims and are not returned or persisted. At most one alternative known title
query is allowed **only when the first successful search yields no admitted
URLs**, not after transport/auth/quota errors or merely to seek a nicer result.
Read at most two distinct admitted candidates sequentially. More candidates are
reported unexamined, not declared absent. Provider-internal traffic is unknown.

Admission reuses the strict assisted policy:
`https://kinobazaua.com/titles/<lowercase-ascii-slug>` only; no query, fragment,
credentials, port (including explicit 443), alternative host, subpage, encoded
slash/dot path, normalization repair or guessed slug. Revalidate before every
GET; redirects/retries are refused. Search ≤15s/512KiB, source card ≤15s/2MiB,
within the remaining source phase of the entry-based deadline. A reservation
that outlives this phase cannot start a later search/card fetch. No
cookies/login/scripts/assets/destinations.

Identity reuses the existing independent canonical/title/original-title/year/
director/stable-ID gates, including unresolved director spellings/composition,
original-title scope refusal and stable-ID conflict priority. These parser
limitations are preserved, not fixed by finding a URL. Refusals withhold claims.
One matched card can contribute source rows automatically even when extraction
is partial. Two matched cards require an explicit choice of already checked
cards; selection adds **zero** requests and cannot override a refused identity.
An identity match is not extraction success, offer identity or account entitlement.

The dialog groups supported platforms for presentation only, keeps each source
row selectable independently, and retains unknown/unmapped observations read-only.
It shows source warnings, literal characteristics in details, localization scope,
shared JustWatch lineage, exact-link acknowledgement and a safe copyable report.
Report content is allowlisted counts/status/scopes; no raw URLs, tracking query,
source body, secret or manually edited draft. Commit remains unknown without
attestation. Clipboard denied/unavailable has selectable text fallback.
Default field exclusions remain price/currency, audio/subtitles/video, status,
owned medium, identity/title/year and added_by. No form write until explicit
transfer; no DB write until ordinary Save. No source request from rendering,
card selection, copy, review, transfer or cancel.

The ledger retains rate rows across list/group deletion: new contexts cannot
erase prior rolling-window usage. Historical foreign-key/RLS issues are not
modified. New accounting stores group/list IDs as technical bindings, checked
against fresh membership/list identity on each RPC, not cascading rate resets.

## Activation / operation plan (not executed)

1. Review #190 → #191 → successor M4.3 dependency diffs; do not merge/deploy as
   part of this task. Confirm production migration history separately; apply
   only the new migration later under explicit authorization.
2. Complete source-use/Brave pricing and attribution preflight, including the
   existing TMDb logo asset used by the dialog. No terms/rules/source retrieval
   was performed in this implementation task. Remaining rights are unresolved,
   not blanket permission or an invented ban.
3. In the provider dashboard obtain a **Web Search API** key, not Answers;
   review current plan/quota/price before any purchase. No account, subscription
   or credits were created here. Set `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` only server-side.
   TMDb Read Access Token and MOTN key remain separate.
4. Reconcile the actual migration baseline before applying the two new M4
   migrations. Review the entry-based hosting deadline and lost-outcome behavior.
   Authorize/configure daily cleanup separately; verify timezone, activation,
   heartbeat and independent monitor ownership. Native PostgreSQL 17.6 concurrency
   has passed locally; deployment/provider runtime behavior is not established.
5. Backend administrator may assign a small per-user, expiring permission using
   the private permissions table via a trusted server/admin path. No default
   grant, client toggle, user metadata claim or new legal acknowledgement switch.
   Keep feature off until these prerequisites and pilot authorization.
6. Five real Wishlist films, selected before requests; record titles/IDs privately
   for the pilot, not invented in this document. One form/discovery action each;
   maximum 40 dispatched source attempts (5 × 8), normally fewer. Search-provider
   internal traffic and manual browser navigation are separate/unknown.
   No full responses or platform sweep. Measure added useful claims as well as
   successful URL resolution; missing offers do not mean resolver failure.
   Stop for any false identity acceptance, unauthorized access, extra requests,
   unexpected writes or lost/manual field propagation. Review brief summaries.

## Verification record

Authored fixtures are not source HTML archives or live coverage evidence.
Real-form Edge browser covers desktop, 375×812 (iPhone X-sized) and 820×1180
(Air-sized), not real iPhone/WebKit validation. It checks social-state isolation,
local transfer, no write before Save, explicit clearing, affiliate acknowledgement,
manual edits, same-session reuse, late replies and clipboard fallback.
Local PostgreSQL/WASM validates only the new migration against minimal authored
prerequisites. Existing research offline/HTTP/security suites protect unchanged
requests, R1/R2 and old modes. No assertion/timeout is weakened.
Launcher/key-routing components are unchanged, but the pure shared URL-policy
import adds a copy-layout dependency. The Windows isolated test fixture now
preserves repository-relative paths; lifecycle is rerun for this concrete risk.
WebKit and live source/resolver behavior remain unvalidated. Windows lifecycle
was not repeated for the narrow #192 fixes: no launcher, key routing, research
transport or Windows fixture dependency changed; earlier evidence is reused only
for that unchanged boundary, not claimed as a new lifecycle run.

### #192 narrow blocker regressions (2026-10-21)

Original findings: pending apply survived Cancel/Escape while awaiting access;
the old 55s source clock excluded preceding Auth/start RPC; access checked before
the advisory lock could become stale while queued. Fixes are selection-token
revocation, entry-based phase deadline, and fresh post-lock authorization.
Authored regressions cover each trigger (not live source reconstruction), pending
close/new selection/manual edits, hanging Auth body/reserve/finish, resolver abort
after reservation, and queued flag/group/card revocation. Native 17.6 tests also
cover concurrent duplicate starts/stages, eight-slot cap, twenty-session cap,
service-only privileges and cleanup health. PGlite tests cover active/younger rows
and no card/Wishlist deletion. The isolated native server is stopped after tests.
Scheduler extension/run integration is **not run**: only inactive configuration
and the health query are prepared, no production job or migration activated.
An authored cron stub verifies the configuration transaction's UTC/refusal,
inactive-job and no-overwrite behavior; it is not evidence of pg_cron execution.

Final narrow-fix run: **43/43 M4 tests passed**, including real-form Edge at
1280×900 / 375×812 / 820×1180 and native PostgreSQL 17.6 with 24 connections;
**29/29** targeted research provider-grouping/matching regressions passed.
13 Markdown documents / 418 local links / 257 anchors: zero errors; whitespace
clean. To repeat native tests, set `M4_NATIVE_PG_MODULE` to the local pinned
`embedded-postgres@17.6.0-beta.15` module's `dist/index.js` before `npm run test:m4`.
No project dependency was added for that portable engine. Without the explicit
module path the native test is **skipped**, not successful native evidence.
Browser tests likewise need `PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE_PATH` and the installed Edge
channel; WebKit is absent. Native runs create authored temporary data and stop
their own loopback server, without installing a Windows service.

Platform references checked 2026-10-21:

and [Supabase Cron scheduling/monitoring](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cron),
[Cron configuration](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cron/quickstart).
These are hosting/database checks, not movie-source rights clearance. The new
code is ready for focused re-review and controlled pilot **preparation**, not
automatic merge, activation or a claim of deployed readiness.

Recorded checks on the assembled implementation:
M4 authored offline/HTTP/SQL + Edge form suite passed; research offline/HTTP
**463/463** passed; Windows `windows.test.ps1 -Discovery` passed parent-exit
survival, duplicate start, inherited mock-key routing, safe stop and restart in
a disposable copy. No actual SSH disconnect was repeated. WebKit executable is
absent. Local links/anchors: 13 Markdown documents, 416 links / 257 anchors,
zero errors; whitespace clean. Exact final counts/remote statuses are recorded
in the implementation PR description rather than guessed here.
